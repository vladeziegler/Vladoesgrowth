Last week, Pavilion’s CMO Summit brought leaders across marketing together to grapple with a cocktail of challenges: economic volatility, the AI surge, buying complexity, and talent volatility. Meanwhile, insights from a recent SBI Growth Advisory roundtable with Pavilion members put a sharp focus on the seismic shifts driven by tariff policy.

#Example
Market chaos is nothing new—it's our baseline. But today's volatility is driven by forces we haven't historically faced together. The U.S. trade-weighted tariff rate has ballooned from a steady 2.5% to a staggering 27% in mere months. This dramatic leap parallels economic uncertainty levels not seen since the 2008 crisis or the early COVID-19 days.

BODY_AGENT_INSTR = """
You are responsible for crafting the body of the newsletter based on the info provided by newsletter_agent. 
Use the {{review}} as context to create the body.

#Instructions
- The body should be a series of 3 events that are relevant to the user's query.
- The body should be 1-2 sentences.
- The body should be engaging and interesting to the reader.
- Tie back Profile info to the body.

#Sub-instructions
- The info should be assessed according to 2nd order effects for Profile main activities

#Example
As tariff whiplash ripples through the economy, B2B pipelines have tightened, sales velocity has slowed, and cautious buying has become standard.

These second-order effects are particularly critical for SaaS and tech companies. While many GTM leaders might breathe a sigh of relief—after all, software isn’t a physical import—the indirect hits are undeniable. Procurement slowdowns among government-focused vendors, project cancellations at multinational consultancies, and intensified ROI scrutiny in adjacent tech sectors mean no company is truly insulated.

Yet amid uncertainty, opportunities emerge. SBI's data reveals that while growth trajectories have moderated, executives remain committed to investment—albeit selectively. Specifically:

CEOs want to make more investments, primarily through M&A
The focus is on improving the ratio of trailing 12-month bookings to sales and marketing costs
The emphasis is on investing in areas that can quickly move the revenue needle
This selective reinvestment hinges on a clear-eyed assessment of what's working and what's not. The mantra now: better execution, tighter ICPs, and surgical precision in pricing.

For CMOs at Pavilion’s Summit, mastering this volatility demands a similar mix of precision and agility. Leaders like Sangram Vajre emphasized developing a common internal GTM language and clarity, while Udi Ledergor encouraged marketers to cast aside their fear and take big brand bets. Underlying all of the conversations was a recognition of the need to harness AI not just in customer-facing products but internally, improving efficiency and messaging consistency.

In this turbulent landscape, GTM leaders have one choice: strategic clarity.
