  On the evening of February 28, 2025, a severe storm with high winds and hail caused significant damage to the roof and exterior siding of the home.

Additionally, a large tree branch fell on the backyard fence, causing structural damage.

**Summary of Claim Decision:**

1. **Covered Damages:**
   - Roof and Exterior Siding
   - Windows
   - Fence
   - Roof Replacement

2. **Uncertain Coverage (Requires Investigation):**
   - Fence Repair: Requires policy examination for standard provisions or exclusion clauses. Supporting documents indicate further policy lookup is required.
   - Temporary Repairs: Incomplete policy review scope; details about emergency or temporary repair conditions need scrutiny.

3. **Not Covered:**
   - None specified in the given information.

**Amount Calculations:**

- **Total Amount Approved:** $8500 for covered repairs (Roof Replacement).
- **Total Amount to Investigate:** $1950 for uncertain repairs (Fence Repair - $1200, Temporary Repairs - $750).

**Actionable Tasks for Investigation:**

- Review the comprehensive policy document for confirmation and authorization of:
  - Fence Repair inclusion or exclusion criteria.
  - Temporary Repair conditions or emergency repair policies.

**Justification for Decisions:**

- Coverage for damages is affirmed by the absence of specific policy exclusions and presence of standard coverage conditions for common storm-related damage types.
- Uncertainty arises due to the incomplete visibility on policy clauses, urging further verification and matching with policy provisions for validation.
